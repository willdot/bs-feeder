## bs-feeder

This is a project that I'm using to play around with the [ATProtocol](https://atproto.com)  that is what powers Bluesky.

The idea is that you reply to a post with `/subscribe` and then when anyone replies to the post you subscribed to, it will appear in a feed that is curated for you.

It is currently a WIP and only configured to listen to `/subscribe` messages from my did (account) but once it's up and running I will open that up.
